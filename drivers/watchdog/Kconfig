config ULP_WATCHDOG
	bool "i.MX7ULP watchdog"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable i.MX7ULP watchdog driver.

config WDT
	bool "Enable driver model for watchdog timer drivers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Enable driver model for watchdog timer. At the moment the API
	  is very simple and only supports four operations:
	  start, restart, stop and reset (expire immediately).
	  What exactly happens when the timer expires is up to a particular
	  device/driver.

config WDT_SANDBOX
	bool "Enable Watchdog Timer support for Sandbox"
	depends on SANDBOX && WDT
	help
		Enable Watchdog Timer support in Sandbox. This is a dummy device that
		can be probed and supports all of the methods of WDT, but does not
		really do anything.
