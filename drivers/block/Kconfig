config BLK
	bool "Support block devices"
	depends on DM
	default y if DM_MMC
	help
	  Enable support for block devices, such as SCSI, MMC and USB
	  flash sticks. These provide a block-level interface which permits
	  reading, writing and (in some cases) erasing blocks. Block
	  devices often have a partition table which allows the device to
	  be partitioned into several areas, called 'partitions' in U-Boot.
	  A filesystem can be placed in each partition.

config SCSI
	bool "Support SCSI controllers"
	help
	  This enables support for SCSI (Small Computer System Interface),
	  a parallel interface widely used with storage peripherals such as
	  hard drives and optical drives. The SCSI standards define physical
	  interfaces as well as protocols for controlling devices and
	  tranferring data.

config DM_SCSI
	bool "Support SCSI controllers with driver model"
	depends on BLK
	help
	  This option enables the SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) uclass
	  which supports SCSI and SATA HDDs. For every device configuration
	  (IDs/LUNs) a block device is created with RAW read/write and
	  filesystem support.

config BLOCK_CACHE
	bool "Use block device cache"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables a disk-block cache for all block devices.
	  This is most useful when accessing filesystems under U-Boot since
	  it will prevent repeated reads from directory structures and other
	  filesystem data structures.

config IDE
	bool "Support IDE controllers"
	help
	  Enables support for IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) hard drives.
	  This allows access to raw blocks and filesystems on an IDE drive
	  from U-Boot. See also CMD_IDE which provides an 'ide' command for
	  performing various IDE operations.
